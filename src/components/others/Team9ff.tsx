          At the top of 9FF is the "Brain": <i>Jan Fatthauer</i>. He perfected
          his engineering knowledge in the field of vehicle technology so much
          that today he is one of the few worldwide, if not the only "engine
          artist", which can get well over 1,000 hp from a production engine.
          <br />
          <br />
          His young team at 9FF consists of highly motivated engineers, talented
          body builders, gifted cars. Masters, hardworking fellows and
          apprentices. And they all live the same dream: do everything a little
          better.
